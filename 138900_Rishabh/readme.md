# Shopping Cart

1. index.html is the entry point.
2. data folder contains the json for feeding item data.
3. items.json contains the data to populate initial cart items.
4. stockitems.json contains data like "all available colors of items, all available sizes of items".


### Web Server extension (Easiest and fastest approach)

1. Add extension [Web Server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) from chrome store to your chrome browser.
2. Navigate to chrome apps home page: [chrome://apps/](chrome://apps/)
3. Launch "Web Server" (200 ok).
4. In the popup web server application, choose the folder to add to server. For me the path was: "D:\SAPIENT_Assignment\138900_Rishabh\"
5. Open ["http://127.0.0.1:8887"](http://127.0.0.1:8887) in any browser. It will work with chrome, firefox, safari and IE.
Note: The local web server port number may be different for you, if the 8887 doesn't work then check for configured port number in "Web server" extension app.

Other than this you can try brackets IDE for hassle-free server setup.
